## About Me: 

Hello! I work in sales and talk to people every day — I like it because I get to help others. Lately, I’ve been curious about the world of computers and how things like websites and apps are made. I started learning little by little, just trying things and having fun. I hope one day I can use what I learn to make something cool, and maybe even help others with it too.
